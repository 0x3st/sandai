## philosophy

### The name of us

This organization is named after a Chinese phrase "传三代" (pass down to three gens). The founder wanted Sandai could live longer and pass down its unique philosophy to more people and later gens.

Meanwhile, the following "Ltd" doesn't means it is a limited company but a organization that limits its amount of members. The reason for this will be explained as follows.

### Why limited

The founder wanted to buid an unpublic space for all people but a specific zone for those who has the same opinion. Such environment surely gives us a precious chance to share our ideas without rude and stubborn disturbution.

Also, a large amount of member is a killer to a thought-provoking group since it should go against someone's profit. 

What's more, monitors form governments, for instance, Uncle Sam and Eastern Dragon.

### What do we talk about

Almost everything. From the earliest creature on the earth to the giants nowadays, we exchange ideas over politics, economics, history, literature, math, phsics, chemistry, biology, geography and so on, as far as you can find your partner.
